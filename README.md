These are MathCAD examples files for the book Published by Springer Nature (2026)

  Guide to Numerical Algorithm Design and Development
  Including Legacy Examples from Fortran and MathCAD in High Precision
  available at:
  https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-90178-2

  Those who purchase this title will have access to electronic copy of the text.
  The end of each chapter at the above URL has a link to Supplementary Material
  that includes all examples listed here as PDF format.

File types in this directory are listed for each Chapter 1-10 as follows:
-  *.mcdx
-  *.PRN
-  *.xlsx
The first is (mcdx) is the file format read in by PTC MathCAD Prime (www.mathcad.com)
The second is (PRN) is either written (as output) or read (as input) by mcdx files
The third is a Microsoft XL spreadsheet file format.

Notes on use.
(1) Purchase of MathCAD is not a requirement to see the examples since they are all
    available as PDF files (see note above)
(1) For those choosing to install a MathCAD license all mcdx files may be opened with
    MathCAD in MS windows
(2) However, before altering (or saving a copy of any of these mcdx( files first create
    your own copy in a separate directory.
(3) work through the mcdx files in sequential order as later files may be expecting
    *.PRN files written by a previous example.
